# Terraform Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up Terraform for managing your infrastructure.

## Prerequisites

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) installed on your local machine.
- An account with your cloud provider (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP).
- Appropriate credentials and permissions to create resources in your cloud provider.

## Steps

### 1. Install Terraform

Download and install Terraform from the [official website](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html).

### 2. Configure Your Cloud Provider

Ensure you have the necessary credentials and permissions to create resources. For example, for AWS, you can configure your credentials using the AWS CLI:

```sh
aws configure
Initialize Terraform
Initialize your Terraform configuration. This will download the necessary provider plugins:

sh
terraform init
5. Plan Your Infrastructure
Generate and review an execution plan. This will show you what actions Terraform will take to achieve the desired state:

sh
terraform plan
6. Apply Your Configuration
Apply the changes required to reach the desired state of the configuration:

sh
terraform apply
7. Verify Your Resources
Verify that your resources have been created successfully. For example, you can check your AWS Management Console to see the new EC2 instance.

8. Destroy Your Infrastructure
When you no longer need the infrastructure, you can destroy it using the following command:

sh
terraform destroy
